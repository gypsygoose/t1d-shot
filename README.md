# Insulin Shot Tracker

A mobile app for people with diabetes who take insulin injections, to track injection sites and enforce site rotation, helping prevent lipodystrophy.

Tap a button on the body diagram to log an injection at that spot. The button's color cycles over a configurable number of days (1–8, default 8) to show how recently that site was used, so you always know which sites are safe to reuse.

**Platform:** iOS / Android — built with Expo (managed workflow), TypeScript, and React Native.

## Features

- Interactive body diagram with 30 injection points across 6 zones (shoulders, belly, thighs)
- Long-press a point to see its body-relative address (row from top, position in the row from the body's center) alongside its history and actions; a toast with the same address confirms every marked injection, calling out a triggered blackout or a backdated mark's date/time when relevant
- Color-coded rotation cycle (maroon → red → orange → yellow → green → white) based on local calendar days since last injection
- Configurable "days to white" delay (1–8 days) to match your own rotation schedule
- Automatic "blackout" cooldown when a site is reused too early, with duration based on how recently it was used
- Manual site lock (long-press) to mark a spot as temporarily unavailable
- Undo, injection history, and import/export of your data — all stored locally on-device, no account or backend required

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start          # opens Expo dev tools — scan the QR code with Expo Go
```

Other useful scripts:

```bash
npm test           # run unit tests (state machine logic)
npx tsc --noEmit   # type-check the project
npm run ios        # run on iOS simulator/device
npm run android    # run on Android emulator/device
```

## Notes

- All data is stored locally on-device (AsyncStorage) — there is no backend or cloud sync.
- UI is currently Russian-only; English localization is planned.
- This app supports injection-site rotation tracking and is not a substitute for medical advice.
